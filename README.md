# Pokedex

The complete pokedex from the 1st to the 1010th pokemon, in the style of Galar's pokedex, using PokeAPI, ordered by generation.

You can access a button to see Alternative forms by removing the `visibility: hidden` of `#gen-10` in the devtools or in the CSS file, however, most of them are blurry or non-existant, especially their shiny sprite.

- Gen 1 : 1 - 151
